# Exoplanet-ADM-Project
This Project has been implemented in both R and Python. In both the languages the source code has been shared.
Advance Data mining Project: Developed different models to analyse Flux intensity Data for the classification of exoplanets . Used supervised machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), ANN (multilayer feed forward), Gradient boosting technique using XGBoost algorithm along with hyper-parameter tuning and Convolution Neural Network (CNN), followed by the application of. Random Forest and Feature Selection (PCA).
